# mpv AppImage

Unofficial AppImage of mpv: https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv

**Can work on any linux system as it bundles everything, even on musl systems.**

It is possible that this appimage may fail to work with appimagelauncher, I recommend this alternative instead: https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM

This appimage works without fuse2 as it can use fuse3 instead.
